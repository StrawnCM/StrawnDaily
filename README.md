# Strawn Daily

This project contains a simple web page for generating a daily newsletter image.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter a title and article content.
3. Click **Generate Newsletter** to download a PNG image of your newsletter.
   The exported image now draws a built-in SVG paper texture for the background.

No server or extra dependencies are required since everything runs in your browser.

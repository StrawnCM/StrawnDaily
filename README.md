# Strawn Daily

This project contains a simple web page for generating a daily newsletter image.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter a title and article content.
3. Click **Generate Newsletter** to download a PNG image of your newsletter.
   The exported image now draws a built-in SVG paper texture for the background.

No server or extra dependencies are required since everything runs in your browser.

## Health Metrics Tracker

The repository also includes `health_tracker.html`, a small React-based page for tracking
daily calories, exercise minutes, and bedtime. Scores for each metric are combined into a
daily score shown in green, yellow, or red. Open the file in your browser to start logging
your own data.
